Notes:
    A few files were taken from the sample code for this assignment, and
    untouched by me. These are noted above in this README file. The code added
    for the assignment is contained within wsng.c. All changes and additions
    were made by me.
    
    I wrote my code using a combination of BBEdit on the Mac, and server-side
    editing using Emacs. Indentation is 4-space wide tabs. Before submission,
    I ran the Emacs command 'M-x untabify' to convert tabs to spaces.
